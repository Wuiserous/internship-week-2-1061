# Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview
Develop a dynamic web dashboard that visualizes data using JavaScript. The dashboard will fetch data (initially from a static JSON file, later potentially from an API), and present it through various interactive charts and tables. The backend will be a simple Python Flask API serving the data.
